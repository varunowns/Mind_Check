## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (or 20+)
- npm 10+

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies across all workspaces
npm install

# Development: run client (Vite) and server in parallel
npm run dev

# Client will be available at http://localhost:5173
# Server will be available at http://localhost:4000
```

### Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Output: client builds to /public, server builds to /dist

# Test across all workspaces
npm run test
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root (or `.env.local` for local overrides):

```bash
# Server
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_PATH=apps/server/data/mindcheck.db
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173

# Optional (auto-detected in Vercel)
# VERCEL=1
```

See `.env.example` for all available options.

## Stress Scoring Algorithm

Stress score is calculated from 0-100 based on:

```
sleep (25%) + workload (25%) + mood (20%) + activity (15%) + meals (10%) + social (5%)
```

**Sleep stress**: Hours and quality penalize heavily—both too little and too much register as stress.
**Workload**: Heavy/overwhelming workload increases stress proportionally.
**Mood**: Negative moods (sad, uneasy) increase stress; positive moods reduce it.
**Activity**: Sedentary patterns increase stress; exercise reduces it.
**Meals**: Skipped or imbalanced meals add stress.
**Social**: Isolation increases stress; social connection reduces it.

Scores are banded into levels: **low** (0-30), **moderate** (31-60), **high** (61-80), **critical** (81-100).

## Relief Suggestions

The app suggests from a curated library of 15 relief strategies across 13 categories:

- **Breathing** — Box breathing, guided calm scripts
- **Stretch** — Neck/shoulder tension relief
- **Journal** — Reflective prompts
- **Music** — Lo-fi and calm playlists
- **Micro-habits** — Small actionable next steps
- **Talk it out** — Self-reflection questions
- **Sleep** — Sleep protection and debt recovery
- **Focus** — Pomodoro blocks, protected focus windows
- **Anxiety** — Pre-exam calm scripts
- **Rest** — Permission to pause
- **Support** — Reach out, professional resources
- **Boundary** — Wind-down rituals
- **Planning** — Meeting load management

Suggestions are personalized based on stress patterns, upcoming events, sleep debt, and burnout status.

## Design Philosophy

MindCheck prioritizes:

- **Compassion**: Warm, non-judgmental language. Stress is normalized and treated as human.
- **Simplicity**: 2-minute check-ins, small relief actions, no overwhelming features.
- **Calm**: Nature-inspired design, soft animations, intentional color palettes.
- **Context**: Suggestions adapt to personal patterns, events, and burnout risk.
- **Agency**: Users choose their own pace—no forced gamification, genuine achievement.

## Development

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server (client + server in parallel)
npm run dev:client      # Start Vite dev server only
npm run dev:server      # Start Express server only
npm run build           # Build all workspaces
npm run test            # Run all tests
npm test:client         # Test React components
npm test:server         # Test API routes
npm test:shared         # Test algorithms
```

### Testing

Tests are written with **Vitest** and **@testing-library/react**:

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test

# Watch mode (in development)
npm run dev:server  # starts with --watch for TypeScript
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables (JWT_SECRET, etc.)
3. Vercel auto-detects monorepo and runs `npm run build`
4. Client output goes to `/public`, served as static site
5. API routes handled by Express server

### Self-Hosted

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start server: `node dist/index.js` (set `DATABASE_PATH` to persistent location)
3. Client is in `/public` and served by Express

## Contributing

2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `npm run test`
