## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+ (or 20+)
- npm 10+

```bash
# Install dependencies across all workspaces
npm install

## Stress Scoring Algorithm

Stress score is calculated from 0-100 based on:

```
sleep (25%) + workload (25%) + mood (20%) + activity (15%) + meals (10%) + social (5%)
```

**Sleep stress**: Hours and quality penalize heavily—both too little and too much register as stress.
**Workload**: Heavy/overwhelming workload increases stress proportionally.
**Mood**: Negative moods (sad, uneasy) increase stress; positive moods reduce it.
**Activity**: Sedentary patterns increase stress; exercise reduces it.
**Meals**: Skipped or imbalanced meals add stress.
**Social**: Isolation increases stress; social connection reduces it.

Scores are banded into levels: **low** (0-30), **moderate** (31-60), **high** (61-80), **critical** (81-100).

## Relief Suggestions

The app suggests from a curated library of 15 relief strategies across 13 categories:

- **Breathing** — Box breathing, guided calm scripts
- **Stretch** — Neck/shoulder tension relief
- **Journal** — Reflective prompts
- **Music** — Lo-fi and calm playlists
- **Micro-habits** — Small actionable next steps
- **Talk it out** — Self-reflection questions
- **Sleep** — Sleep protection and debt recovery
- **Focus** — Pomodoro blocks, protected focus windows
- **Anxiety** — Pre-exam calm scripts
- **Rest** — Permission to pause
- **Support** — Reach out, professional resources
- **Boundary** — Wind-down rituals
- **Planning** — Meeting load management

Suggestions are personalized based on stress patterns, upcoming events, sleep debt, and burnout status.

## Design System & Components

### Glassmorphism Design

MindCheck uses a modern **glassmorphism design system** with:

- **Glass effect**: Backdrop blur, semi-transparent backgrounds, and layered shadows create depth
- **Theme variables**: Light and dark modes with CSS custom properties for consistent colors across the app
- **Smooth animations**: Framer Motion for entrance, hover, and interactive states
- **Accessible spacing**: Standardized gaps (space-1 through space-8) and border radii

### Shared Component Library

Core UI components live in `apps/client/src/components/` and are reused across all pages:

**Glass Components** (glassmorphism-styled):
- `GlassCard` — Base glass effect container with variants (default, accent, elevated, subtle)
- `GlassMetric` — Stat card with label, value, icon, and trend indicator
- `GlassStat` — Animated progress stat with bar fill and percentage
- `GlassButton` — Button with glass, primary, secondary, or ghost variants
- `GlassFormSection` — Form container with title and description

**UI Components**:
- `StressRing` — Circular progress visualization of stress score (0-100)
- `BreathingCircle` — Animated box breathing guide (inhale, hold, exhale)
- `CheckinProgressBar` — Step progress indicator for multi-step flows
- `MoodPicker` — Emoji-based mood selection grid
- `StressorChips` — Multi-select chip buttons for stressor categories
- `JournalCard` — Card for journal entry preview with date and tone
- `BadgeCard` — Achievement badge with lock state
- `TipCard` — Wisdom/guidance card with optional icon
- `ThemeToggle` — Light/dark mode switcher

**Other Components**:
- `MetricCard` — Simple metric display (used on dashboard)
- `Layout` — App shell with header, nav, and footer
- `ReliefSuggestionCard` — Relief suggestion with icon, description, steps, and CTA
- `StaggerItem` — Wrapper for staggered entrance animations

### Theming

Light and dark themes are defined via CSS custom properties in `apps/client/src/styles.css`:

```css
--bg-base        /* Page background */
--bg-surface     /* Surface layer */
--bg-elevated    /* Elevated component */
--accent-primary /* Primary color (sage green) */
--accent-secondary /* Secondary color (warm tan) */
--text-primary   /* Body text */
--text-muted     /* Muted/secondary text */
--glass-bg       /* Glass effect background */
--glass-border   /* Glass effect border */
```

Theme is stored in `localStorage` and applied via `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. The `useTheme()` hook manages toggling.

## Design Philosophy

MindCheck prioritizes:

- **Compassion**: Warm, non-judgmental language. Stress is normalized and treated as human.
- **Simplicity**: 2-minute check-ins, small relief actions, no overwhelming features.
- **Calm**: Nature-inspired design, soft animations, intentional color palettes.
- **Context**: Suggestions adapt to personal patterns, events, and burnout risk.
- **Agency**: Users choose their own pace—no forced gamification, genuine achievement.

## Development

### Scripts

```bash
npm run dev              # Start dev server (client + server in parallel)
npm run dev:client      # Start Vite dev server only
npm run dev:server      # Start Express server only
npm run build           # Build all workspaces
npm run test            # Run all tests
npm test:client         # Test React components
npm test:server         # Test API routes
npm test:shared         # Test algorithms
```

### Testing

Tests are written with **Vitest** and **@testing-library/react**:

```bash
# Run all tests once
npm run test

# Watch mode (in development)
npm run dev:server  # starts with --watch for TypeScript
```

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect repository to Vercel
2. Set environment variables (JWT_SECRET, etc.)
3. Vercel auto-detects monorepo and runs `npm run build`
4. Client output goes to `/public`, served as static site
5. API routes handled by Express server

### Self-Hosted

1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start server: `node dist/index.js` (set `DATABASE_PATH` to persistent location)
3. Client is in `/public` and served by Express

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Please:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests: `npm run test`
5. Commit with clear messages
